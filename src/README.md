Notes:

1)	I have created the dummy data for plotting it on graph as the API was only sending journal data of year 2018.
2)	I have not created any other module since it isn't required. ./src/app is the main component
3)	I had bind the click event instead of hover on chart element since I was not able to find any package which has that functionality.
4)	Same goes for the year picker, I was able to not able to find the only year picker package.
